# Simple ToDo list application.
## Requirements
* Ability to view, add, edit, delete items in a ToDo list
## Notes
 Use visual studio or vs code to create a solution targeting .NET Core
 Create interfaces, services, models, repositories, unit tests, controllers, views, etc.
 Setup the solution structure as you would for any full-fledged application
 Use dependency injection
 Use an in-memory implementation for the database
 Feel free to use Entity Framework for data access
 This does not need to handle multiple users
 Please post completed application to a public Git Repo with a readme file
